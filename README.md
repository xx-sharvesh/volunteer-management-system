Volunteer Assignment System
The Volunteer Assignment System is a web-based platform designed to facilitate the assignment of volunteers to various events based on their availability and interests. The system serves as a centralized hub where individuals interested in volunteering can register their information, including their name, interests, and availability. Organizers of events can then utilize this platform to efficiently assign volunteers to upcoming events based on their preferences and availability.

Creating a Virtual Environment:

To create a virtual environment, which helps in managing dependencies for different projects, you can use the following command:

python3 -m venv venv

This command creates a virtual environment named `venv` in the current directory.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing Requirements:

After creating the virtual environment, activate it and then use `pip` to install the required dependencies consecutively:

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Flask
pip install Flask

# Install Pandas
pip install pandas

These commands will install Flask and Pandas within the virtual environment, ensuring that your project's dependencies are isolated from other Python installations on your system.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To Run the Flask application
flask run
This command starts the Flask development server, and you can access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:5000.
